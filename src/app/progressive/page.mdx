# Progressive Response example

Demonstrates an experimental feature called "Progressive Response" that implemented with `JSONLinesResponse` on the server and handled with `progressive` function on the client. For demonstational purposes users and tasks resolve in random order, using `setTimeout` with a random delay of 0-10 seconds. Press "Load" button to load users and tasks. The response is streamed progressively, so you can see the results as they come in, rather than waiting for the entire response to be ready. Open devtools to see the network requests.

## Result

<Example>
  <ProgressiveExample />
</Example>
