# Form with files

Example of form with files using Zod validation. Notice that "portfolio samples" can be uploaded as multiple files as well as a single file, and the validation model for this field is defined as a union of `z.file()` and `z.array(z.file())`.

## Result

<Example>
  <ZodFormExample />
</Example>

## Code

<GithubFiles paths={['src/modules/form/FormZodController.ts', 'src/app/form/ZodFormWithFilesExample.tsx']} />
